### Ruby Heaps
- Created when preparing a blog post on heaps (https://medium.com/@j.masland/what-the-bleep-is-a-heap-2b1afc20c167).
- Implements the heap and the closely related priority queue in Ruby.
- Contains a "monkey-patch" to add heap_sort and heap_sort! methods to the Array class (analogous to `sort` and `sort!`)
- Not super efficient (due to its implementation in Ruby rather then C) - created for demonstration purposes.
- Includes Rspec tests for several test cases
